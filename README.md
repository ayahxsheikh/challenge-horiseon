## Code Refractor -Horiseon
## Description 
The project aims to refractor the code to make it more accesible and optimise the site for search engines.  
It does this  wihout chaning the css layout of the website which was part of the user requirements.
The code has been edited to include HTML semantics and has modified the linked type selectors in the CSS file.
Refractoring this code to include HTML semantics makes it easier for other developers to read through and change or fix code in case errors occur. 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions and screen readers.
Making a website accessible is also good for business reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google.
